	<h2>About Us</h2>	

	<p>
Dominic, owner of Dominic's NY Pizza has over 20 years of experience in the restaurant business cooking Italian food.  Dominic grew up working in family owned Italian restaurants and from a young age he knew cooking and serving food was his life's passion.  Dominic believes that every ingredient used in every dish from appetizers through entrees to desserts is important enough to be made from fresh ingredients with loving care from someone who loves what he does.  Competitive pricing is our goal while continuing to use nothing but the highest quality ingredients.  Our ingredients are fresh and used in family recipes handed down for generations.  We make our dough fresh daily, buy and slice our own meat, make our own meatballs from scratch, crush our own imported Sicilian tomatoes by hand and refuse to use processed ingredients. <br>
<br>

From December 2012 until January 2014 Dominic partnered with Clay Oven Mediterranean Restaurant in Marietta, GA.  He established Dominic's NY Pizza as the place to go for the best wood fired brick oven pizza in Atlanta and began building a following of loyal repeat customers. <br>
<br>

In late 2013 Dominic envisioned a mobile wood fired brick oven pizza trailer, contracted a company to bring his idea to fruition and went mobile.  He left Clay Oven in January 2014 to concentrate on events and festivals.  Dominic took his pizza trailer for it's maiden voyage on March 29, 2014 receiving rave reviews and praise from astonished customers, many of whom had never even seen a wood fired brick oven much less a mobile wood fired brick oven before. <br>
<br>

  Please join us at any one (or all) of the events/festivals that we have planned for 2015.  For more information go to News to find out where Dominic's will be this weekend.

If you would like to book Dominic's NY Pizza for an event but have a special kind of food in mind other than pizza, strombolis and calzones we would be happy to accommodate your individual needs.  We can cook anything in our brick oven.  Email us or give us a call with your personal request(s).

Dominic's NY Pizza is a licensed and trademarked brand.  Franchises will soon be made available.</p>
